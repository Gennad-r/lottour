					<p><strong>2 day - Kumrovec and Ptuj, Slovenija</strong></p>
					<div>
						<p>After breakfast we depart to the village of Kumrovec where Yugoslavian president Marshal Josip Broz – Tito (1892–1980) was born. We will visit Tito Museum.</p>
						<p>Josip Broz Tito was the central figure of Yugoslavian Struggle for National Liberation. After Yugoslavia was occupied by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Tito led an extensive guerilla from the mountains of Bosnia and Montenegro, liberating vast mountainous areas in the heart of Nazi occupied Europe. So dedicated was the Yugoslavian guerilla army that the Germans had to maintain a force of at least 500.000 soldiers for a very small territory – at the time when these soldiers were much needed elsewhere. After liberation, Tito’s Yugoslavia defied Stalin and created a unique system of market socialism, maintaining good relations with Soviet Union as well as the West. Yugoslavia remained peaceful and the most prosperous socialist country for 45 years, but after collapse of the Soviet Union all 7 ex-Yugoslavian countries have become independent (the process of division took place from 1991 to 2008) – Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegowina, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Slovenia and Croatia are now full members of the European Union and negotiations are on the way with other countries.</p>
						<p>When we reach Slovenia, we turn to the wine country of Styria.</p>
						<p>Ptuj is a small town of only 18.000 people which proves that sometimes size does not matter. Its history goes back 2.700 years and has always been connected with wine. The best red wine is made in France, but the best white wine is made in Austria and Slovenia, with Ptuj being the oldest champion. The oldest wine cellar in Ptuj goes almost 800 years back (established in 1239), 200 years older than the oldest in France.</p>
						<p>We will see the houses of Ptuj wine merchants and descend below the earth to the ancient wine cellars where we can try some samples. We will also stop at the vineyards for spectacular scenery.</p>
						<p>Night in Ljubljana.</p>
